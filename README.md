## Introduction

Implemented linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise. 

## Implementation

Linear regression was applied to predict restaurant profits using city populations. Steps included dataset loading, visualization, model implementation with gradient descent, cost computation, training, and visualizing the linear fit. The outcome was hands-on experience in model components and gradient descent optimization.
